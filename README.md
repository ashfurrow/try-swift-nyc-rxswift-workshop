Materials for my [try! Swift NYC](https://www.tryswift.co/events/2017/nyc/) Workshop on [RxSwift](http://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/issues/579).

Instructions
------------

The projects in the Examples directory are integrated with CocoaPods, but all the dependencies have been checked in. That means you should be able to download this repo and open the *workspaces* in each subdirectory. All examples should work with iOS 10 / Xcode 8.x.
